## Who am I?
I don't know, you tell me! ðŸ˜‚
I'm kidding, my name is Alejandro CastaÃ±o Rojas, but you can call me Alejo ðŸ‘¾
I'm currently studying systems engineering and working at [Experimentality](https://www.experimentality.co/) and I have strong beliefs that education is the right way to change the world.

Here are some facts about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software & data engineering problems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data driven architectures, reactive principles and streaming analytics (this may vary, look again in a couple of months)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software design, clean code or enterprise level good practices
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can contact me in [telegram](https://t.me/alejocas)
- âœ¨ Make education accesible to all
- âœŒ Don't underestimate the knowledge of others
- âš¡ My preferred languages are Scala & JavaScript; but I also know how to write good (in terms of mantainable and scalable) Java, Python and SQL
